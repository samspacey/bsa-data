      "body": "As a first time buyer I had come to YBS for my AIP as reviews in the whole area good. I applied for the AIG online and once I had this I called the ‘mortgage advisors’ as informed in the AIG to ensure I had chosen the most appropriate mortgage. I was told we cannot advise you and we really are not able to discuss particulars of each mortgage. However confident I chosen the correct one I completed the full application. I called again to ensure the application had been received and to ask a few other minor questions. A few days later had not heard not even a confirmation email so called again and was transferred to the underwriters. Again asked a few questions to ensure I had everything correct and all seemed well. I received a telephone call today advising ‘sorry we don’t mortgage a flat it’s just policy but we can keep your account open if you want to choose another house’. Firstly this is not a pair of shoes it’s not as simple as picking another it’s the house I will live in for the rest of my life. Really disappointing that at no point going through all of this information 3 times that someone didn’t think to mention it was all a huge waste of time. Really poor service and why advertise mortgage advisors who are not permitted to advise.",

Then on my re-mortgage I decided to pay yorkshire building society £70 for their re-evaluation (other companies had theirs free if I changed providers) and they used a terrible company with 2* reviews everywhere, the guy came out, took some pictures and left. didnt ask about electric, boiler, windows NOTHING.
