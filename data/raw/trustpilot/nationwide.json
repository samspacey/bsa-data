      "body": "I have an ISA and credit card with Nationwide but not a current account. I use the mobile banking app to check spending on my credit card and to check my ISA balance.Ten days ago I got a new phone. My banking apps with other providers transferred to the new phone with no issues in a matter of minutes. The Nationwide app is still not working 10 days later.I phoned Nationwide as the app on my new phone would for some bizarre reason not recognise my mobile banking pass number. I was told by the CS representative that my pass number was for telephone banking and that I should authenticate my account using my card reader. I explained that I do not have a current account, have not used telephone banking and do not have or need a card reader for my credit card. She then agreed to reset my pass number. This was supposed to come by post in the next 3-5 days. 8 days later it still has not arrived. I visited a branch to register a complaint about this but have heard absolutely nothing. My next step will be the financial ombudsman. I am far from impressed with the Nationwide.",

      "body": "I've been a loyal Nationwide customer for over 40 years. But I'm seriously thinking of leaving now because of theen set up.bsolutely disgusting run around I've had with their AUTOMATED telephone system on 03457 302011. All I wanted to do was check whether a Direct Debit with British Gas had been set up about 4 days ago as I could not see it in my App or online. So I phoned Natiowide up but there was NO WAY to get a check on whether a DD had been set up. It ALWAYS SENT ME BACK TO JUST READING OUT MY LAST FEW TRANSACTIONS. I asked several times to be put towards a human agent BUT NO, NOT POSSIBLE. So I tried First Direct and guess what a HUMAN answers the phone every time. MY DAYS WITH NATIONWIDE ARE NUMBERED. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. NO WONDER THEIR RATING IS SO RUBBISH.UPDATE 28/11/25: So Nationwide have replied on here saying I should raise a complaint. I did indeed raise a complaint yesterday in my local branch (which is now only open 3 DAYS A WEEK). But I have to say the employee who took my complain seemed very disinterested, offered no sympathy or help in trying to get me through to a human. Anyway, let's see if NW actually do phone me up like I was told they would. I'm not holding my breath though judging by the ABYSMAL Trustpilot rating they are showing. I recently had a query with my Tesco Credit Card needing me to speak with a HUMAN. And, guess what NO PROBLEM AT ALL IN GETTING THROUGH TO A HUMAN. As I said, I'll soon be off to FIRST DIRECT if Nationwide do not give me a satisfactory resolution to this issue. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",

I have now raised a case with the ombudsman due to their appalling conduct.

What they have done to me is beyond disgraceful — it is cruel, reckless, and completely indefensible.After 12 years of loyal custom, they have chosen to destroy my financial stability with a single cold email. They are closing my account on the 15th of December — just TEN DAYS before Christmas — because I am self-employed and dared to receive my own earnings into my own personal account.Let me make this perfectly clear:If you receive wages from an employer, Nationwide welcomes you with open arms.If you receive earnings as a sole trader — your own money — you are treated like a criminal.Tell me what the difference is?My income is clean. My business is legal. My transactions are entirely legitimate. I could show nationwide if they had bothered to ask, or even care. But Nationwide have decided that my money is unacceptable because it doesn’t come from an employer’s payroll system.I am using a personal current account for “business use.”I call it discrimination against anyone who is self-employed. There is no law which says a sole trader needs a designated business account. I pay the money I earn by working into my account, So I can buy groceries, prescriptions and pay bills with the income from that same account. but that is a breach of their terms and conditions, I am not allowed to use my personal account for business use. They are my wages, that I earn by working extremely hard.And here is the part that shows their true colours:Nationwide know — because I told them when contesting the closure of my account — that:My photo ID is expiredI have no other form of photo IDReplacing my ID takes up to 3 weeksChristmas delays will make it longerI cannot open another bank account without valid IDI will be left completely without a bank accountI will be unable to pay my billsI will be unable to buy stock or post ordersI will have to shut my business downI will have no income during the busiest period of the yearI have money in my account, I dont feel safe withdrawing this large amount of money and walking around with it or keeping it under the mattress. It still leaves me unable to operate my business or receive payments, also will leave me unable to pay my tax and national insurance on January 31st.This will leave me financially stranded 10 days before ChristmasAnd do you know how Nationwide responded?They simply did not care.They sent a templated message, 'business use' washed their hands of me, and left me to deal with the devastation that they caused.Nationwide are happy to take your money for 12 years straight.Happy to profit off your loyalty.Happy to let you believe you’re a valued customer.But the moment your income doesn’t fit neatly into a wage slip, they will shut you down without a second thought.I have never been treated so coldly and carelessly by any bank — or any business — in my life.Their actions are not just “inconvenient.”They are financially destructive.They have put me in an impossible position where I will have to close my business. Let my bills fall into arrears until I can get another bank account (when i can jump through all the hoops that are needed to get a photo ID, I have no passport, only a very old and expired provisional licence and a birth certificate - but those arent worth anything anymore.)This is how ordinary people are pushed to breaking point, and eventually break.Not because of wrongdoing — but because of indifference.If you are self-employed, a sole trader, a creator, a freelancer, or anyone who earns your living without an employer — avoid Nationwide at all costs.They are not safe.They are not supportive.They are not understanding.They are not humane.They are a building society that punishes people for working for themselves — and they will destroy your financial stability without hesitation, just as they have done to me.Nationwide have shown me exactly who they are:Cold. Inflexible. Dehumanising.And absolutely unworthy of the trust they demand.I will never forgive them for this.",

      "body": "Nationwide have completely disrupted the purchase of my first home. I am due to complete in 6 days, having had my mortgage offered to me in August (not expiring until Feb 2026). Today, less than a week before completion, Nationwide sent me an email to say they were reverting my mortgage offer as they wanted some bank statements to be sent to them.Nationwide know that I am due to complete in less than a weeks’ time as my solicitor has informed them.All of the contracts are signed, the house deposit has been withdrawn from my account, and I have ordered furniture (with deposits being paid) to arrive in 2 weeks.When I called nationwide they said they needed to see my bank statements because the address of my solicitor had changed. I asked why a change to my solicitors address meant that they had to check my bank statements. Nationwide are not lending to my solicitor, they are lending the money to me, and none of my circumstances have changed. So how is my affordability eligibility any different than in August? And why has my solicitors address changing triggered the need for bank statements for me?Furthermore, my solicitor’s address changed 7 weeks ago on 1st October. My solicitor updated all the relevant platforms and all other lenders were aware of their change of address on 1st October. So this is just nationwide. they had 7 weeks to contact me for my bank statements, but they have waited until 6 days before completion. Their response was that it’s a system process that they cannot override - they need to see bank statements. No more was explained to me.Just to add - during the mortgage application in August, nationwide never asked me for bank statements. They sent me the mortgage offer without having seen my statements. Therefore I am guessing this is a fault on their part where they forgot to request my statements and they are blaming it on the solicitors address changing? This is penalising me for something that is not my fault with not even a sorry.I have raised a complaint and sent my bank statements to nationwide. Been told that it will be 3 working days minimum before I hear back.I was sobbing on the phone to the people I spoke to and they didn’t give me any indication about why this has happened or how it will be resolved. I felt alone and confused and really mistreated.I was due to exchange contracts today, if that had occurred before nationwide made me aware of this, then I would have been open to financial penalties for pushing back the completion date due to nationwide’s fault.Therefore my current position is that I do not have the house deposit in my account anymore, I do not even have a valid mortgage offer, I’m likely to lose £1000s in furniture deposits, I will not complete on the set completion date, I am absolutely devestated and stressed with all the uncertainty, and ultimately this has ruined what should have been the most exciting time being a first time buyer. I’m none the wiser as to WHY this has happened or HOW it is going to be resolved.What I do know is this issue with nationwide has massively knocked me and I’m very very distressed.Nationwide - how can you revert a mortgage offer when you are aware it is 6 days before completion?",

      "body": "If I could give zero stars, I would.My experience with Nationwide Home Insurance (underwritten by RSA) has been nothing short of a slow-motion catastrophe; a masterclass in mismanagement, miscommunication, and utter disregard for customer wellbeing.What began as a routine escape-of-water claim spiralled into a psychological and financial nightmare. Despite providing every conceivable form of evidence (council tax records, utility bills, photographic proof of occupancy, invoices, even video evidence) I was met with suspicion, delay, and bureaucracy at every turn. The investigating agents (contracted by RSA) repeatedly asked for documents I had already submitted, then allowed the claim to stagnate for months on end, citing unresponsive third parties who had no legal or contractual obligation to reply.At one point, I was even interrogated in a manner that felt adversarial, not investigative, leaving me so distressed that I had to withdraw my claim entirely on mental health grounds. The process left me tens of thousands of pounds out of pocket, emotionally drained, and deeply disillusioned.And yet, the indignities didn’t stop there.Months after formally withdrawing my claim and closing my complaint, I was delivered a letter stating my claim was declined, and that evidence of remedial work needed to be submitted. After providing that evidence, I was promised in writing a follow-up letter confirming the claim had been correctly marked as “withdrawn”, not “declined” - Nationwide’s own admitted administrative error. That letter was never sent. Fifteen working days later, I’m still waiting, but instead, I received a nonsensical letter about a cancelled Direct Debit, implying that I owed money on a policy I had explicitly chosen not to renew.The right hand doesn’t seem to know what the left is doing.Nationwide once traded on a reputation for trust, integrity, and care. Today, it feels like a hollow brand; a bureaucratic labyrinth in which empathy and accountability have been completely abandoned. What should have been a straightforward insurance claim became a year-long ordeal that robbed me of sleep, peace of mind, and tens of thousands of pounds in unreimbursed costs.I write this not out of anger but out of exhaustion, because customers deserve to know the reality: Nationwide is no longer the dependable institution it once was. If you value your sanity, avoid them at all costs.(I have been given so many references over the year that I'll just quote the latest - CRM:0336878)",

I hadn't made an appointment. My husband wanted to open a current account on the same day. He was asked to fill out his details on a tablet device (which he's not very familiar with), but there were plenty of staff to help. The branch was busy and very friendly. It seems to me that NW are filling a gap that the high street banks are opening, in their approach to customer service. There appeared to be a lot of older people in the branch at the time of our visit. However, I'm sure people of all ages appreciate a personal approach. We were also told that help was available with modern tech; for those who needed it.On 3rd November, I telephoned NW to clarify something said in a letter I'd received. I spoke to Ella, who said she was speaking from Caerphilly. I live in Wales. It was nice to speak to someone relatively local, as the way people speak is different across the Uk. I'm in my 70's, and my hearing isn't bad, but I sometimes find it difficult to understand a strong accent from another part of the country. Emma was empathic and understanding. She reassured me about the wording of the letter, and we discussed further ways that Nationwide could help. I said I would like to see my account online, and she said she'd make sure I received a communication that would guide me in this.Going back to last Autumn; I'm pretty sure that Olivia was the person I spoke to, in branch, when my father had passed away.

I have made another attempt, and abandoned it in its turn.  Unless one whips one's finger away from a card reader button quickly, it's liable to repeat a digit.

There is no clue on how to access the transactions.Presumably there is a way, but Nationwide isn't telling..  I think Nationwide is run by sadists.Possible final update before I return to my previous bank.  Nationwide has no regard for the fumbling fingers of the elderly.

      "body": "I've always had a great experience with Nationwide so it's a shame to see all the negative reviews. My experience with HSBC and now Natwest has convinced me Nationwide will be the bank I always bank with from now on. The app has always worked really well and now you can download documents from it it's even better. They've stopped my card immediately when they suspected fraudulent activity which I was very thankful for. And every time I've ever visitied in branch or had to call them, I can speak to an agent very quickly and they are always very helpful and give accurate information. They give you £100 every year just by being part of the bank too! I would recommend the bank",

      "body": "My account was frozen when i sent money to my account with an online bankMy account was frozen when i sent money to my account with an online bank- my standing orders were rejected. I was treated firstly like child and then a criminal - I was on the phone for 50 mins with someone who was enjoying winding me up ,he told me my account wouldn't be unblocked until he was happy - and that started 45 mins of abuse of power - even when i said forget the transaction he wouldn't unfreeze the account and kept me on the line. That cant be right - It only stopped when i said i was closing the account - it left me traumatised and very angry - feeling like i lived in Stalins Russia - this person needs retraining at the very least. A complaint is in the system but i'm not hopeful of justice. My opinion of nationwide couldnt be lower. Owned by your members? - thats a joke. If they are responsible for people being scammed around crypto they should setup their own crypto services not treat long standing customers like this. A day later after a visit to a helpful branch my account was freed up and the transaction approved.",

      "title": "Computer Says No",
      "body": "I received a letter from Nationwide on 7 October 2025 stating that my current deal would expire on 31 October 2025 — giving me only 24 days’ notice. When the deal ended, my rate jumped from 3.14 % to 6.75 %, more than doubling my monthly interest cost by around.Nationwide later told me that the “annual statement” sent in February 2025 was sufficient notice. I strongly disagree: that document was a routine statement and only mentioned the product expiry in very small print. It did not provide a clear or timely warning or invite me to take action. If the annual statement were truly adequate notice, there would be no reason for Nationwide to send a dedicated expiry letter at all — yet they did, only 3 weeks before expiry.If they firmly believed the Annual Statement was enough, then im still struggling to understand why they sent an official product expiration letter 3 weeks before expiring.I believe Nationwide breached the Mortgage Charter commitment to provide ‘well-timed information’ and failed to meet the FCA’s Consumer Duty and Treating Customers Fairly principles, which require firms to give customers clear, timely information to help them make effective decisions, at least 4 months notice.I raised a complaint with them , and they firmly dismissed they failed to meet standards.What makes the whole incident worse, is the arrogant , self centered response to my complaint.Nationwide, on a number of occasions , while I  was a customer, have heavily depended on very poorly designed algorithms, for which \"Computer Says No!\"I cant recall on a single occasion where they considered my financial situation, that sat outside their algorithm(s).Anyway, its a vent, that will not be concluded by nationwide staff that have been trained to take orders from a CPU.Hope you enjoyed the Rant 😏",
